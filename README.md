# Final Project

In this repo, there are 3 folders separating my final projects.

## Deteccion de cubrebocas

In this folder, I trained a model using a CascadeClassifier to detect when someone is using a face mask and when someone is not wearing it.

## Deteccion de flores

In this folder, I train a model with convolutional neural networks to identify and classify different types of flowers: daisy flower, magnolia flower, rose flower, sunflower, water lily.
This project is written in a Jupyter Notebook and has different sections to guide the process.

## Phaser

In this folder, there is a little game that can be trained and learn how to evade the bullets fired by a subject. With this training, the character should be able to survive in auto mode.
